# THE PLAN: Magic Card Scanner Cloud Deployment Strategy

## üéØ **Overall Vision**
Transform the Magic Card Scanner from a single-user local application into a multi-user cloud-hosted service where users can:
- Access their card collection from anywhere
- Each user has their own isolated card database
- Maintain full scanning and AI identification capabilities
- Scale to support multiple concurrent users

## üèóÔ∏è **Current State Analysis**
- **Local Setup**: Single-user FastAPI application with SQLite database
- **AI Integration**: OpenAI Vision API for card identification
- **File Storage**: Local uploads directory for card images
- **Database**: SQLite with good separation of concerns
- **Environment Setup**: Development (port 8001) and production (port 8000) environments already configured

## üöÄ **4-Phase Deployment Strategy**

#### **Implementation Steps**:
1. **Database Schema Changes**:
   - Add `user_id` to `Card`, `Scan`, `ScanImage`, `ScanResult` tables
   - Create database migration scripts
   - Update all database queries to include user filtering
   - Add database indexes for performance

2. **API Endpoint Updates**:
   - Modify all endpoints to filter by current user
   - Update card CRUD operations
   - Modify scan history and results
   - Ensure upload isolation

3. **File Storage Isolation**:
   - Implement user-specific upload directories
   - Update file serving to check user permissions
   - Migrate existing files to user-specific locations
   - Add file cleanup for user deletion

4. **Data Migration**:
   - Create scripts to assign existing data to primary user
   - Test multi-user scenarios
   - Validate data isolation

**Success Criteria**: Each user sees only their own cards and scans

### **Phase 4: Production Polish & Scale** (Week 4)
**Goal**: Production-ready application with monitoring and admin features

#### **Technical Objectives**:
- Add comprehensive logging and monitoring
- Implement admin dashboard
- Add user management features
- Optimize performance for multiple users
- Add backup and recovery systems

#### **Implementation Steps**:
1. **Admin Dashboard**:
   - Create admin user role
   - Build admin interface for user management
   - Add system health monitoring
   - Implement usage analytics

2. **Performance Optimization**:
   - Add database query optimization
   - Implement caching where appropriate
   - Add API rate limiting per user
   - Optimize file storage and serving

3. **Monitoring & Logging**:
   - Set up application logging
   - Add error tracking (Sentry integration)
   - Implement health checks
   - Add usage metrics

4. **Backup & Recovery**:
   - Set up automated database backups
   - Implement user data export
   - Add disaster recovery procedures
   - Create data retention policies

**Success Criteria**: Production-ready app with monitoring and admin capabilities

## üõ†Ô∏è **Technology Stack Decisions**
