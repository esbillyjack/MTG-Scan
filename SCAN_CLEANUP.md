# Scan History 404 Error Fix - Database Cleanup

## Issue Resolved
Fixed 404 errors in scan history where users were seeing "No Image" placeholders for scan images.

## Root Cause
The database contained 150 scans with 0 associated cards that were never properly cleaned up. These scans had various statuses (PENDING, CANCELLED, READY_FOR_REVIEW, PROCESSING) but never produced any cards, yet their references remained in the scan history.

## Solution Implemented
Performed database cleanup to align with new policy: **"Scans are only kept if they produce cards"**

### Cleanup Results
- **Removed**: 150 scans with 0 cards
- **Preserved**: 14 scans with associated cards  
- **Cards**: 79 cards maintained (no data loss)
- **404 Errors**: Completely eliminated

### Database State Before/After
- **Before**: 164 scans (150 empty + 14 with cards)
- **After**: 14 scans (all with cards)
- **Result**: Clean, functional scan history with no broken image links

## Zero-Card Policy Implementation ✅ NEW!

### Policy Details
**Effective Date**: January 13, 2025  
**Policy**: Scans that result in 0 accepted cards automatically trigger storage cleanup

### Implementation
When a scan is committed with 0 accepted results:
1. **Scan Record**: Preserved in database for audit trail
2. **Image Files**: Automatically deleted from uploads directory
3. **Database References**: ScanImage and ScanResult records removed
4. **Status**: Scan marked as "COMPLETED" with cleanup notes
5. **User Notification**: Clear message about storage policy applied

### Benefits
- **Storage Efficiency**: Prevents waste from unsuccessful scan attempts
- **Audit Trail**: Maintains record of when scans were attempted
- **Performance**: Reduces file system bloat and database size
- **User Experience**: Clear communication about storage policies

### Technical Details
```python
# Zero-card policy triggers when:
accepted_results = query(ScanResult).filter(
    ScanResult.scan_id == scan_id,
    ScanResult.status == "ACCEPTED"
).all()

if not accepted_results:
    # Policy implementation:
    # 1. Delete physical image files
    # 2. Remove database image references  
    # 3. Update scan record with cleanup notes
    # 4. Return success with policy notification
```

### API Response
```json
{
    "success": true,
    "scan_id": 123,
    "status": "COMPLETED", 
    "cards_created": 0,
    "policy_applied": "zero_card_cleanup",
    "files_deleted": 3,
    "message": "Scan completed with 0 cards - images removed per storage policy"
}
```

## Future Prevention
With the zero-card policy in place, orphaned scans will no longer accumulate in the system. Every scan will either:
- **Produce cards**: Images and scan data retained
- **Produce no cards**: Images automatically cleaned up, audit record maintained

## Deployment Status
- **Development**: ✅ Implemented and tested
- **Production**: ✅ Ready for deployment
- **Documentation**: ✅ Updated in scan policies endpoint (`/scan/policies`)
