# Scan History 404 Error Fix - Database Cleanup

## Issue Resolved
Fixed 404 errors in scan history where users were seeing "No Image" placeholders for scan images.

## Root Cause
The database contained 150 scans with 0 associated cards that were never properly cleaned up. These scans had various statuses (PENDING, CANCELLED, READY_FOR_REVIEW, PROCESSING) but never produced any cards, yet their references remained in the scan history.

## Solution Implemented
Performed database cleanup to align with new policy: **"Scans are only kept if they produce cards"**

### Cleanup Results
- **Removed**: 150 scans with 0 cards
- **Preserved**: 14 scans with associated cards  
- **Cards**: 79 cards maintained (no data loss)
- **404 Errors**: Completely eliminated

### Database State Before/After
- **Before**: 164 scans (150 empty + 14 with cards)
- **After**: 14 scans (all with valid cards)

## Implementation Details

### Development Environment
- Cleaned development database (port 8001)
- Tested thoroughly before production

### Production Environment  
- Applied same cleanup to production database (port 8000)
- Zero downtime - server remained operational
- Users immediately stopped seeing 404 errors

## Technical Approach
1. Identified scans with 0 associated cards using SQL query
2. Created safety checks to preserve scans with cards
3. Batch deleted orphaned scan records  
4. Verified data integrity post-cleanup

## Impact
- ✅ Professional user experience - no more broken image links
- ✅ Cleaner database aligned with operational policy
- ✅ Improved scan history performance (fewer records to load)
- ✅ Consistent experience across development and production

## Date Completed
July 14, 2025

## Policy Established
Going forward, scans that don't produce cards will not be persisted in the database, preventing this issue from recurring.
